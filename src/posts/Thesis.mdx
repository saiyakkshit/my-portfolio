This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performance of ARCore and WebXR APIs for augmented reality (AR) applications, specifically focusing on cloud-based object visualization integrated with â€‹Firebase. The study aims to determine which API is more suitable for this type of application by analyzing CPU load, network latency, and frame rate. Two AR applications were developed using ARCore and WebXR APIs with Firebase cloud, and performance metrics were collected and analyzed. The results showed that WebXR API performed better in terms of CPU load and frame rate, while ARCore API performed better in terms of latency. Overall, the study concludes that the WebXR API is more suitable for efficient and responsive object visualization in AR applications.
